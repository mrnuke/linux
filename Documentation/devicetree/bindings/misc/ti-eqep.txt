* Texas instruments eQEP quadrature decoder

Required properties:
- compatible : must be "ti,am33xx-eqep"
- reg : physical base address and size of the registers map.
- count_mode : Should be one of "quadrature", "clock-dir", "up" or "down".
    - "quadrature" : The QEPA/QEPB signals are quadrature encoded
    - "clock-dir" : QEPA is a clock signal, and QEPB is a direction signal.
    - "up" : count up on QEPA transitions. QEPB is ignored.
    - "up" : count down on QEPA transitions. QEPB is ignored.

Optional properties:
- clocks: Handle to the eQEP's functional clock.
- clock-names: Must be set to "fck".
- qa_inverted : The QEPA signal is inverted.
- qb_inverted : The QEPA signal is inverted.
- qi_active_low : Index channel (QEPI) is active low.
- qs_active_low : Strobe signal (QEPS) is active low.
- ti,swap_qepa_qepb : Select QEPA signal as QEPB input and vice-versa. This
    effectively causes the encoder to count in the opposite directon. This
    setting is only effective when the "count_mode" is set to "quadrature".

Example:

eqep0: eqep@0x48300180 {
	compatible = "ti,am33xx-eqep";
	reg = <0x48300180 0x80>;
	clocks = <&l4ls_gclk>;
	clock-names = "fck";

	count_mode = "quadrature";
	qi_active_low;
};
